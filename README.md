# ZPL Syntax Highlighting for Sublime Text

Note: This is a major work in progress.

Currently supports:
- 2-character function names
- ^FN variables
- ^DFR and ^ISR templates names
- ^FD Strings

Function parameters are the next priority. If anyone wants to jump in and help
with that, be my guest. I believe that each function will need it's own pattern
definition with all of it's potential options specified in order to keep the
parser from continuing into a string.
